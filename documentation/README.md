# Documentation Folder Readme

This folder is intended to contain Markdown (`.md`) files that document aspects of the CGT project.

## Expected files
Expected files in here include:

1. **Rationale, Background information, and Hypotheses**
  - Literature review establishing what we already know.
  - Definition of the main question(s) being pursued in the study.
  - Hypotheses about the relationships & results to be found in the study.
2. **Design & Methods**
  - Broad design sketch identifying the flow of the experiment and the main measures being collected, and in what order.
  - Concrete details for each portion of the design as needed, including details like numbers of trials, timing, detailed content, and other necessary parameters of the design.
3. **Analysis plan**
  - A big-picture perspective on broadly how data & will be examined using what tools to answer which questions
  - Concrete details about software packages, calculation approaches, etc.
4. **Summary of Results**
  - _Note: this is intended to supplement the actual `.R` or `.Rmd` files used to calculate, visualize, and document the results, and so should describe the results at a simpler, more abstract level, emphasizing meaning & interpretation._

## Goals
The goals of this documentation are to:
- Facilitate the creation of formal manuscripts and presentations.
- Document information when it's fresh & accessible.
- Possibly facilitate the subsequent sharing of this project (e.g. directly on GitHub, or using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)).
