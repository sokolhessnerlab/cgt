In this study, we are interested in understanding how the level of difficulty of risky monetary choices affects reaction time and how this relates to cognitive control. Specifically, you complete a letters task followed by a monetary decision making task. Then you will complete a few brief questionnaires. There are no right or wrong answers. Please do your best to answer each question quickly and accurately based upon your initial instinct or "gut feeling".
