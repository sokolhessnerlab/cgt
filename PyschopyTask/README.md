# PsychoPy Tasks (OLD)

- We first stored the task on Github as we were programming the study before pushing it online. Once we pushed it online, we needed to move the study out of Github since Pavlovia uses Gitlab.
- The versions of the task that you see in this directory are not the most recent, but we will keep them here for reference/future use if necessary.
- Midway through programming, we switched from doing ospan to digit span.
