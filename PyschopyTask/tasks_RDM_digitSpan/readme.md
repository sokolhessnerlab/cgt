This study consists of two tasks. The first is a gambling task and the second is 
a simple digit span based on (cite) and (cite).

Participants complete two rounds of a gambling task. The responses from the first round
are used to select the choiceset for the second round.

After the gambling task, participants complete 14 trials of a forward and backward digit span task.
In the forward span task, participants start with a digit span of 3. If participants recall the digits correctly, the next trial will 
increase by a single digit. If participants respond incorrectly once, they will remain at the same digit for an additional trial. 
If participants respond incorrectly twice in a row, the digit span will decrease by one. This will continue until 14 trials.
The backward span task is similar with the exception that participants start with a digit span of 2.
